        <p class="question">Q1: Talk about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did. Briefly explain one challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you overcame it. </p>
        <p class="answer">
          <b>A: </b> I created a simple one-page website with scrolling sections. It includes a brief introduction about me and a section where I answered the required questions. I chose to use HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework because they allow for quick and efficient styling while ensuring responsiveness. Additionally, I have experience with these technologies, making the development process smoother.
          <br><br>
One challenge I encountered was ensuring that all sections scrolled smoothly and aligned correctly on different screen sizes. At first, some sections didn’t display properly on smaller screens, but I resolved this by adjusting Bootstrap's grid system and using CSS media queries.
<br><br>
Deploying the site on Netlify was straightforward. After connecting my GitHub repository, Netlify handled the deployment automatically. Within a minute, I was able to preview my site live. The seamless integration with GitHub made updates quick and hassle-free, allowing me to focus on refining the content and layout.

        <p class="question">Q2: What did you think of our service during the time you used it? Provide some constructive criticism or some features that impressed you.</p>
        <p class="answer">
          <b>A: </b> 
          Overall, I had a great experience using Netlify for deploying my site. The setup process was incredibly smooth, and I appreciated how quickly my site went live after connecting my GitHub repository. The automatic deployment feature made it easy to update changes without any manual intervention, which was very convenient.

          One feature that impressed me was the continuous deployment, which ensured that any updates I pushed to GitHub were automatically reflected on my live site.
          
          As for constructive feedback, while the platform is user-friendly, I think providing more built-in templates or UI components for basic static sites could help beginners get started even faster.   </p>

        <p class="question">Q5: Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think are two major challenges around DNS configuration for less-technical customers hosting websites.</p>
        <p class="answer">
          <b>A: </b> I think, One major challenge for less-technical customers when configuring DNS is understanding the different types of DNS records and their functions. Terms like A records, CNAME records, MX records, and TXT records can be overwhelming for those unfamiliar with how domain name resolution works. For example, users may struggle to differentiate between an A record (which maps a domain to an IP address) and a CNAME record (which points one domain to another). Misconfiguring these records can lead to website downtime, email delivery failures, or security vulnerabilities. Without clear guidance, many customers might rely on trial and error, which can cause frustration and delays in getting their website live. Even as an IT professional, I had some difficulties understanding these concepts when I first started, as DNS settings can be quite technical and often require troubleshooting. <br>
          <br> Another significant challenge is DNS propagation time and troubleshooting. When a customer updates their DNS settings, changes can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours to fully propagate across the internet. This delay often leads to confusion and uncertainty, as users may not understand why their changes aren’t reflected immediately. Additionally, if something goes wrong—such as an incorrect nameserver configuration or a missing record—diagnosing the issue without technical knowledge can be difficult. Many less-technical users don’t have experience using tools like nslookup or dig to verify DNS changes, leaving them dependent on support teams for troubleshooting. When I was new to web development, I also found DNS troubleshooting frustrating at times, especially when dealing with propagation delays and incorrect configurations. These challenges highlight the need for user-friendly DNS management tools and clear documentation to help non-technical users navigate the complexities of domain configuration.

        <p class="question">Q6: A customer writes in to Support saying simply that their “site won’t build”. You have access to their build logs, and there you see this error: Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2. You have no more information than this and the site’s source repository is private so you cannot test the build yourself. How would you troubleshoot this issue? What steps would you take? Also, please compose your best customer-facing first response.</p>
        <p class="answer">
          <b>A: </b> If a customer reports that their “site won’t build” and the build logs only show the error "Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2," troubleshooting can be tricky without access to their repository. The first step I’d take is to ask for more details—specifically, if they recently made any changes to their code, dependencies, or build settings. Since this error generally means something in the build script failed, I’d also check if they’ve tried running the build locally. If it fails locally, that’s a strong indication that the issue is within their project rather than Netlify’s build system. Additionally, I’d ask them to provide the full build log, as the error message itself isn’t very descriptive, but there could be useful details earlier in the log that help pinpoint the cause. <br>
          <br> For my first response, I’d keep it friendly and informative while guiding the customer toward troubleshooting steps. I’d ask if they updated dependencies, changed build scripts, or modified configuration files like netlify.toml or package.json. I’d also suggest they try installing dependencies again (npm install or yarn install) and running the build command locally to see if they can reproduce the error. If they can share the full build log, that would help identify any specific issues. By keeping the response straightforward and actionable, I’d ensure the customer knows exactly what to check next without feeling overwhelmed.

        <p class="question">Q7: How would you set up an http 301 status redirect from “/netlify/anything” on your site, to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything. Please provide the redirect formatting here. Now, how about a proxy redirect? Please add that proxy redirect rule directly to your site. (Please add the proxy redirect to your website!)</p>
        <p class="answer">
          <b>A: </b> According to my research with Netlify, setting up a 301 redirect from /netlify/anything to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything can be done using either a _redirects file or the netlify.toml configuration. In the _redirects file, I would add the rule /netlify/:query https://www.google.com/search?q=:query 301!, which captures anything after /netlify/ and appends it as a search query on Google. Alternatively, using netlify.toml, I would include a redirect configuration like [[redirects]] from = "/netlify/:query" to = "https://www.google.com/search?q=:query" status = 301 force = true, ensuring that all requests to /netlify/anything permanently redirect to the appropriate Google search page. This method is useful for SEO-friendly, client-side redirection where the browser updates the URL to the new destination. <br>
          <br> If I needed a proxy redirect, which fetches the content from Google while keeping the original /netlify/anything URL structure, I would modify the redirect rule to return a 200 status code instead of a 301. In the _redirects file, this would look like /netlify/:query https://www.google.com/search?q=:query 200, while in netlify.toml, I would configure it as [[redirects]] from = "/netlify/:query" to = "https://www.google.com/search?q=:query" status = 200 force = true. This way, the content from Google Search would be served directly under the original /netlify/anything URL. After adding these configurations to my site’s root directory and deploying the changes, Netlify would handle the redirection accordingly.

        <p class="question">Q8: Please attempt to deploy a function on our service. This need not be complicated. It could be "Hello World". Note that failure to deploy is not failing the exercise! Whether you have trouble or not, please describe what you experienced and how you attempted to troubleshoot any issues you encountered.</p>
        <p class="answer">
          <b>A: Click the button</b></p>

          <button id="fetchMessage">Click Me</button>
    <p id="message"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById("fetchMessage").addEventListener("click", function () {
            fetch("/.netlify/functions/hello")
                .then(response => response.json())
                .then(data => {
                    document.getElementById("message").innerText = data.message;
                })
                .catch(error => console.error("Error fetching function:", error));
        });
    </script>

    <p>I attempted to deploy a simple "Hello World" function on Netlify, but since I am new to adding functions, I encountered some challenges along the way. I started by creating a functions folder inside my project and adding a file named hello.js with a basic function that returns a JSON response. To ensure Netlify recognized the function, I also added a netlify.toml file specifying the functions directory. After committing and pushing my changes to GitHub, the deployment was triggered automatically on Netlify. However, when I tried accessing the function via /.netlify/functions/hello, I encountered a "Page Not Found" error. To troubleshoot, I checked the Netlify Deploy Logs to verify if the function was detected and manually triggered a redeploy. I also reviewed the Functions Logs for any errors, but despite these efforts, the function was still not responding as expected when clicking the button in index.html. I am still troubleshooting why the fetch request isn't working, possibly due to incorrect JavaScript implementation or function serving issues on Netlify. Although the button is not yet triggering the function, this experience has helped me understand the process of deploying serverless functions on Netlify, and I plan to continue debugging until it works correctly.</p>

        <p class="question">Q9: We understand you don't know anything about our internal procedures at this stage, but we want you to explain at a high level how you'd react to this situation: You receive a report of a severe security issue on www.netlify.com. You can't immediately confirm the report, so what steps might you take to investigate or substantiate the report? What might you say to the reporter, even though we haven't confirmed their assertion yet, that will instill confidence that our business is very concerned about security? You believe there is a reasonable chance the report is correct and the problem is very large and impactful. How might you escalate?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          <b>A: </b> If I received a report of a severe security issue on www.netlify.com but couldn't immediately confirm it, my first step would be to carefully review the details provided by the reporter. I’d check if they included any proof of concept, affected areas, or steps to reproduce the issue. If I had access to logs or monitoring tools, I’d look for any suspicious activity related to their claim. Since security issues can be time-sensitive, I’d also try to replicate the issue in a safe testing environment without causing any disruptions to live systems. If I couldn’t confirm the issue myself, I’d reach out to more experienced security team members or internal experts for a second opinion. <br>
          <br> While investigating, I’d acknowledge the reporter professionally and let them know that we take security seriously. I’d thank them for their report and let them know that we are actively reviewing it. Even though I can’t confirm the issue yet, I’d reassure them that we follow a responsible disclosure process and will keep them updated as we investigate further. If the issue seems severe and potentially widespread, I’d escalate it immediately to the appropriate internal team, ensuring it gets prioritized. Depending on company protocol, I might also flag it to leadership or security specialists so they can assess the potential risk and take action as needed.
